# Case Study - Hypothesis Testing

## Where stuff is 
* `notebooks/student.ipynb` -> notebook where work goes
* `data/northWind.sqlite` -> dataset you'll be using
* `images/` -> put any images you use here
* `notebooks/` -> if you make extra notebooks, put them here

## Instructions
* Answer the following questions using sampling distributions
* For each question
    * Setup a hypothesis test writing H0 and HA
    * Conduct test with a alpha of 0.05
    * Show distributions in a visualization
        * Use a legend to label distributions
    * Write a conclusion
    * If there is a difference in means
        * Use Cohen's D to measure the effect size
        * Conduct a Power Analysis
* Remember if you have multiple groups use ANOVA and Tukey Testing
* Work should be done in the `student.ipynb` file found in the `notebooks/` directory
* Create a custom README.md for your repo
